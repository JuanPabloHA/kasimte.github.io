This is a short summary of the key terms from the [excellent video, "A
more formal understanding of functions"](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations/linear-transformations/v/a-more-formal-understanding-of-functions), from the Linear algebra
section on Khan Academy.

At its core, a *function* is just a mapping of one set to another set.
So, for example, for every element in set X, we associate an element
in set Y. And then we call this association a *function*.

The origin set is called the *domain*. The destination set is called
the *co-domain*. These sets are part of the function definition,
although oftentimes people donâ€™t mention them.

A more concrete example might be 

$$
f(x) = x^2
$$

Alternatively, this may be written as 

$$
f: x \mapsto x^2
$$

The second notation perhaps expresses the association better. This
function maps the *domain* of real numbers to the *co-domain* of real
numbers. Or, in other words, for this *function*, we can put in any
real number and it will give us a real number back.

The subset of the co-domain that is actually mapped is called the
*range*. So, for example, if we had a function g, which takes in any
two-dimensional real number and returns 2, the codomain may be the set
of real numbers, but the range would be limited to 2.

When the co-domain is a one-dimensional real number, the function is
called a *scalar valued function* or a *real valued* function. When
the co-domain maps to multi-dimensional real number, the function is
referred to as a *vector valued function*.

Key Terms:

* function
* domain
* co-domain
* range
* scalar valued function
* vector valued function
