title: "Anki and Siri on Mac OSX for Flashcard Drilling"

I've been burshing up my Mandarin for an upcoming trip and have come up with a new flashcard tactic to drill both recall and pronunciation simulatenously.

For flashcards, I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net), known for its spaced repetition approach, and sometimes only add a recall based card (with the thought that if I can recall a word, then I will likely be able to recognize it). 

On Mac OSX, I have been placing it side by side with Siri (activated by holding command-space), and pronuncing it as well. 

Below is an example where the card is "monster" and it expects 怪兽 (*guàishòu*).
