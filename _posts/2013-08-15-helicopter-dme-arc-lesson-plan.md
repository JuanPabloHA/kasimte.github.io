This lesson provides an overview of DME arcs and how to fly them in a
Robinson R44 IFR trainer equipped with a Garmin 430W GPS.

### Student Preparation

Reading Assignments

- Read the [chapter on DME arcs](https://www.amazon.com/Instrument-Training-Developed-Professional-Courses/dp/0916413268).
- Review the [VOR-A GDM approach plate](http://www.airnav.com/airport/GDM).

Sample Ground Questions

- Examine the [COPTER ILS OR LOC/DME RWY 23 plate at KFMH](http://www.airnav.com/airport/FMH). Why is the
  069 radial explicitly marked “LR-069”? If it were a 10NM DME arc,
  would you expect this to be closer or farther away from the approach
  course radial? Why?
- In what situations may a DME arc be convenient (e.g., save time)?

<!--
- Where is the DME receiver in [N171WT](https://www.flightaware.com/resources/registration/N171WT)?
-->

### Flight Elements

- Depart westbound from KBED off simulated RV (e.g., depart heading 270, climb maintain 2500).
- Instructor simulates clearance to intercept and track V431 westbound towards GDM.
- Intercept and turn northbound to fly a 10NM DME arc.
- Stay on the arc until flown within 0.2 NM for consecutive turns or for at least 3 turns of the OBS.
- Intercept a turn inbound towards the GDM VOR.
- Start preparing for the VOR-A approach at KGDM with a simulated DME arc entry.
- At the VOR, turn and fly the 240 radial outbound.
- Off the outbound course, intercept the 10NM arc and turn northbound (simulated DME arc as an IAF).
- Turn inbound 097 to intercept the final approach course (see the approach plate).
- Land at GDM or go missed as appropriate.
- Airwork enroute back to KBED followed by a GPS 23 or ILS 29 at KBED full-stop.

### Equipment

- Book a Robinson R44 IFR trainer (e.g., N171WT)
- Current approach plates
- Low Altitude Enroute Chart
- Instrument hood

### Completion Standards

Student will answer all ground questions correctly and review any
questions for which there are problems with an instructor,
demonstrating an understanding of DME arc fundamentals.
