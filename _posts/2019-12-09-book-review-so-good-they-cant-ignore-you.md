A few years back, a friend recommended *So Good They Can't Ignore
You*, and I finally got around to reading it. Here is a summary in my
own words (mostly for myself).

## Key Concept

Naively doing what you love is stupid. Instead, create a track record
of something rare and in demand in order to exchange for the control
that most people seek in their life.

## Outline

### Rule 1: Don’t Follow your Passion.

*The passion hypothesis* says do what you love. This seems intuitive,
but it’s actually dangerous and often backfires.

### Rule 2: Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You

What instead then? “*Be so good they can’t ignore you.*”

Why? Let’s compare *the craftsman mindset* and *the passion
mindset*. The craftsman continuously works on getting better and
offering more value. The passionate amateur sits back and says, “how
much do I like this?”

What happens? The craftsman accumulates *career capital*, rare and
valuable skills, which typically only come through sweat. The
passionate amateur gives up when it gets hard.

And you need rare and valuable skills to exchange for rare and
valuable jobs. So be a craftsman first and consider passion
later. This is *the career capital theory of great work*.

What does being a craftsman entail? Many people talk about *the 10,000
hour rule* (make sure you’re putting in the time) and *deliberate
practice* (make it quality time, where you’re actually being pushed to
improve).

Also of note, if the *career capital market* in your field is
*winner-take-all*, focus on the one skill that matters and ignore all
else.  This is less important if your field is *auction*-based, where
the winners are diverse.

### Rule 3: Turn Down a Promotion

Some are convinced that if they only had the courage to pursue their
passion, all would be well. Let’s call this *courage culture*. This is
folly because it’s not just courage that is required, but also
*career capital*.

People who love their jobs have *control*. They choose when and how
they do their work. Do not make a bid for more control without the
requisite career capital, however, or it will not be sustainable. This
is *the first control trap*. Once you do have the requisite *career
capital*, your employer will likely fight you from making a
change. This is *the second control trap*. This may come in the form
of a promotion, which limits your control.

How do you know avoid the above two traps? Use money as a litmus
test. If someone is willing to pay you for something, you can use it
to bid for more control. If not, you shouldn’t. This is the *law of
financial viability*.

### Rule 4: Thinks Small, Act Big

Finally, careers often benefit from some overarching *mission*. Good
missions are often found in *the adjacent possible*, implying you
should use the craftsman mindset to reach the cutting edge of your
field. Doing so is often difficult, but can be mitigated by *little
bets*, small (say one-month long) projects that both push your limits
and explore. What makes a good project? You’ll know you’re on to
something when people are inclined to say something about it (*the law
of remarkability*).

## Practical Tips for Craftsmanship

* The author has a *research bible routine*, in which he summarizes a difficult paper every week. This helps ensures he stays a craftsman by pushing his limits.
* The author has an *hour-tally routine*, mounted behind his desk, which is metric of how much *deliberate practice* he is getting in.
* The author has a *theory-notebook routine*, where he records new theory results in an overly expensive notebook, encouraging more *deliberate practice*.

## Conclusion

This book doesn’t read poetically, but it doesn’t have to. It lays out
a solid framework for avoiding deadly career pitfalls by consolidating
concepts and a vocabulary around sensical ideas that you may not want
to hear. It then adds some practical examples and tips.  Ignore at
your own peril.
