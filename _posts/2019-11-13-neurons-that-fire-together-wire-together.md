I’ve come back to the [3Brown1Blue YouTube
series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
on Neural Networks a few times now, but only recently took the time to
sit down and try to digest them thoroughly. This time around, I find
myself wishing that they had been the first stop when I first started
digging into deep learning earlier this year. At times, deep learning
can feel like just a lot of funny mathematical notation, which in a
sense it is, but these videos do a great job of both keeping with that
notation, but also granting an intuitive perspective as to *what* is
going on and *why*, one of the hallmarks of a great teacher.

Just as a small example, when explaining back propagation, he takes
the time to mention the potential link
to [Hebbian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory). In
a phrase, “neurons that fire together wire together.” Perhaps it’s a
stretch to say that artificial neural nets really mimic the inner
workings of a human brain, but it sure does solidify the concept.
