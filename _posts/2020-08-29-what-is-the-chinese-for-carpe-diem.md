title: What is the Chinese equivalent of carpe diem?
tags: chinese poetry

While discussing *carpe diem* recently with a friend, I was led to
the *Golden Dress Song*, a gem of a [Tang dynasty poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_Qiuniang):

劝君莫惜金缕衣,
*quàn jūn mò xī jīn lǚ yī,*

劝君惜取少年时。
*quàn jūn xī qǔ shǎo nián shí.*

花开堪折直须折，
*huā kāi kān zhē zhí xū zhē,*

莫待无花空折枝
*mò dài wú huā kōng zhē zhī.*

Here is Victor Mair's translsation:

<blockquote>
I urge you, milord, not to cherish your robe of golden thread,
<br/>
Rather, milord, I urge you to cherish the time of your youth;
<br/>
When the flower is open and pluckable, you simply must pluck it,
<br/>
Don't wait till there are no flowers, vainly to break branches.
</blockquote>

When I think of carpe diem, my thoughts drift to gathering rosebuds
from
[To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Virgins%2C_to_Make_Much_of_Time),
to which the Golden Dress Song has been compared:

<blockquote>
Gather ye Rose-buds while ye may,
<br/>
    Old Time is still a-flying:
<br/>	
And this same flower that smiles to day,
<br/>
	To morrow will be dying.
</blockquote>

This has me wanting to read more of *<<Three Hundred Tang Poems>>*, an
anthology that is apparently a gem of Tang dynasty poetry, which
itself is a considered a gem of Classical Chinese literature.
