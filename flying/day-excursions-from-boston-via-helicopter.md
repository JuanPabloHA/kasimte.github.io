Fly from Hanscom to New York, with a fuel stop at

the houses and boats.

### Newport, Rhode Island (KUUU)

Go into town for clam chowder and then tour the mansions from the
air. Optionally fly through Providence on the return.

### Provincetown, Massachusetts (KPVC)

Cut through Boston's Class B and take the BAYE route across the water
to the south shore. Cross the water again around Marshfield towards
P-town. Walk down Commercial Street, have lunch, visit the Portuguese
Bakery, and return.
