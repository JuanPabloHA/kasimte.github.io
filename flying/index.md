Here are some resources for my helicopter students, back from when I
used to instruct. Those days are mostly long gone, but I like to think I still get out
every once in a while.

* [DME Arc Lesson Plan](helicopter-dme-arc-lesson-plan)
* [New York City Lesson Plan](new-york-city-helicopter-lesson-plan)
* [Day Excursions](day-excursions-from-boston-via-helicopter)
* [Helicopter Chekckride Review Questions Addendum](helicopter-checkride-review-questions-addendum)

Also, find my [flying resume here](resume).
