### Objective

The student shall plan and conduct a cross-country flight from Hanscom
Field (KBED) to New York City, with a tour through the Hudson River
and optionally the East River VFR corridors, and then back to
Hanscom. 

This lesson is best suited for a private helicopter pilot
working on their commercial helicopter rating, but may be adapted to
any rated helicopter pilot interested in NY airspace.

Answer the following questions on your own before showing up for the
lesson:

- Where will we enter and exit the Hudson River VFR corridor?
- Do we have to fly through any of the New York Class B airspaces?
- If so, who should we call and on what frequencies?
- When we are flying in the Hudson River corridor, who will we talk to? What about the East River?
- At what altitude and airspeeds should we fly?
- What are our reporting points?

### Flight Elements

- Ground discussion (30 minutes)
- Preflight (45 mins)
- Flight (5-6 hours)
- Post Flight Debriefing (20 mins)

particularly in and around New York Class Bravo airspace, the Hudson
