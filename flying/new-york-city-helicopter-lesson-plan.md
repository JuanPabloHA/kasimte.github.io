### Objective

The student shall plan and conduct a cross-country flight from Hanscom
Field (KBED) to New York City, with a tour through the Hudson River
and optionally the East River VFR corridors, and then back to
Hanscom. 

This lesson is best suited for a private helicopter pilot
working on their commercial helicopter rating, but may be adapted to
any rated helicopter pilot interested in NY airspace.
