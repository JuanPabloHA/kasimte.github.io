If you're preparing for your oral exam for your helicopter license,
the
[Helicopter Pilot Oral Exam Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Helicopter-Pilot-Oral-Exam-Guide/dp/161954010X/) is
a good start and reviews most of what you need to know.

Here are some other questions you might be asked that you should
really know anyway.

### Scenario Based

- When flying over poles, where do you cross? Why? If there are
  electical wires, will you be able to see them?

- You have an engine failure while flying over a highway. Assuming a
  calm wind, which side of the highway is preferable for an
  autorotative landing?

### R44 Systems 

- Hydraulics. You are flying cross-country in the R44. You have a
complete electrical failure. Do your hydraulics fail? Why or why not?
What if you have the hydraulics switch turned to the OFF position?
What happens if your electrical system fails?

- Refer to the emergency procedure for an electrical fire. Does it say
to turn the master battery off? How about the alternator? Will your
tachs still operate if you turn off both? Will your governor?
