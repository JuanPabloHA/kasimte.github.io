# Kasim Te's Personal Website

This is my personal website. Trying to keep it simple:

* hosted on GitHub Pages ([Click Here to see the actual site](https://kasimte.github.io))
* built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* based off the [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
* tags added based off the [tutorial here by Long Qian](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/)

## Tips

Build the site for production:

```
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```
