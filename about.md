Hi, I'm Kasim Te. Welcome to my site.

### Now

I'm currently at [KAIST](http://www.kaist.edu) in
the [Knowledge Service Engineering](https://kse.kaist.ac.kr/)
department through the [KSchool](https://kschool.kaist.ac.kr/)
master's program.

It's been fun and humbling to be back in school, learning mostly from
people
much
[younger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauvain-marseille-409ab1152/)
and [smarter](https://github.com/Zymrael) than me, particularly having
had some teaching experience in other fields but no formal science and
engineering background.

Here are some of the courses I've taken:

* [Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Jkparkaist/IE801)
* Helicopter Aeromechanics
* Machine Learning for Knowledge Service
* Human Computer Interaction
* [Startup Marketing](https://sites.google.com/view/startupmarketing/KEI540)
* Business Intelligence

### Previous

* I made [LawStack](https://www.lawstack.com) and some other mobile apps.
* [I used to fly and instruct helicopters some outside Boston](/flying).
  * If you are preparing for a pilot's knowledge examination, I made [some iPhone apps](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=faa+test+prep+tekk+innovations+app+store&t=brave&ia=web) for that.
  * If you want the [FAR/AIM on your phone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/far-aim-by-lawstack/id328979186), I made an app for that too.
* [Spent a year in South Korea on a Fulbright grant, teaching middle school students](https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/two-umass-amherst-students-receive-fulbright-grants).
* Studied Chinese at [UMass/Amherst](http://www.umass.edu) and [Fudan](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) back in the day.

### Blog

Find more on [blog here](blog/). I mostly write about whatever I'm learning
at the moment (trying to focus on deep learning as of late).
