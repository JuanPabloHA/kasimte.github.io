Hi, I'm Kasim Te. Welcome to my site.

### Now

I'm currently at [KAIST](http://www.kaist.edu) in
the [Knowledge Service Engineering](https://kse.kaist.ac.kr/)
department through the [KSchool](https://kschool.kaist.ac.kr/)
master's program. I've mostly been looking at ways to apply HCI and
machine learning.

### Previous

* I made [LawStack](https://www.lawstack.com) and some other mobile apps.
* I used to fly some outside Boston. Here's [one of my favorite lesson plans](/flying/helicopter-dme-arc-lesson-plan) I developed with a student.
* Spent a year in South Korea on a [Fulbright](http://www.fulbright.or.kr/) grant.
* Studied Chinese at [UMass/Amherst](http://www.umass.edu) and [Fudan](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) back in the day.
