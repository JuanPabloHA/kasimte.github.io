Hi, I'm Kasim Te. Welcome to my site.

### Now

I'm currently at [KAIST](http://www.kaist.edu) in
the [Knowledge Service Engineering](https://kse.kaist.ac.kr/)
department through the [KSchool](https://kschool.kaist.ac.kr/)
master's program.

It's been fun and humbling to be back in school, learning mostly from
people
much
[younger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauvain-marseille-409ab1152/)
and [smarter](https://github.com/Zymrael) than me, particularly having
had some teaching experience in other fields but no formal science and
engineering background.

Here are some of the courses I've taken:

* [Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Jkparkaist/IE801)
* Helicopter Aeromechanics
* Machine Learning for Knowledge Service
* Human Computer Interaction
* [Startup Marketing](https://sites.google.com/view/startupmarketing/KEI540)
* Business Intelligence

### Previous

* I made [LawStack](https://www.lawstack.com) and some other mobile apps.
* [I used to fly and instruct some outside Boston](/flying).
* Spent a year in South Korea on a [Fulbright](http://www.fulbright.or.kr/) grant, teaching middle school students.
* Studied Chinese at [UMass/Amherst](http://www.umass.edu) and [Fudan](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) back in the day.
